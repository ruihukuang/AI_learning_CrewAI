  - Sets the account balance to the initial deposit amount and initializes other attributes.

- `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Increases the account balance by the specified amount.

- `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Decreases the account balance by the specified amount if there are sufficient funds.
  - Records the transaction.
  - Returns `True` if the withdrawal was successful, otherwise `False`.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Purchases the specified quantity of shares at the current price obtained from `get_share_price(symbol)`.
  - Decreases balance by the total purchase price, if sufficient balance is available.
  - Updates holdings to include the new shares.

### Testing and UI
This module is designed to be self-contained, allowing for direct integration with test cases and potential UI components for further development.

## Usage:
To interact with the Account class, instantiate it with the desired account ID and initial deposit. Use the account methods to perform operations such as depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and trading shares. The account can provide real-time reports on portfolio value, holdings, transactions, and profit/loss.
